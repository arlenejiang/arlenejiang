# Code Sample from NESC 3505: Assignment 2
### Looping Through Files

This code automates data analysis, reading data files and outputting mean reaction times for each subject. 

```python

# List of subject IDs, which correspond to file names
IDs = ['s10', 's12', 's13', 's14', 's15']
```



```python
for subject in IDs:
    file = pd.read_csv(subject + '.csv')
    print(subject)
    print('Mean reaction time in the congruent condition for ' + subject + ' is ' + str(file.loc[file['flankers'] == 'congruent', 'rt'].mean() * 1000) + ' ms')
    print('Mean reaction time in the incongruent condition for ' + subject + ' is ' + str(file.loc[file['flankers'] == 'incongruent', 'rt'].mean() * 1000) + ' ms')
```
