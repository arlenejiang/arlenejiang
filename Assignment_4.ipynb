    "### Data Source\n",
    "These data were provided courtesy of Dr. Nathan Crowder, Department of Psychology & Neuroscience, Dalhousie University. Data are from 23 mouse primary visual cortex neurons; for simplicity we are going to work with data from only 6 of these neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Design\n",
    "- Visual stimuli were sine wave gratings drifting (oscillating) at 2 Hz (cycles/sec)\n",
    "- Each trial was 4000 ms in duration. \n",
    "- Data are sampled at 1000 Hz, meaning that we have a data point every 1 ms.\n",
    "- The stimuli were presented under 2 experimental **conditions**: control (CTRL) and adaptation (ADAPT). \n",
    "    - In the **CTRL** condition, each trial began with a 2000 ms blank grey screen, then the oscillating sine wave grating at the trial's contrast level (see below) for 1000 ms, then 1000 ms blank grey screen.\n",
    "    - In the **ADAPT** condition, each trial started with the adaptation stimulus, a 50% contrast sine wave grating for 2000 ms, then the sine wave grating at the trial's contrast level (see below), then 1000 ms blank grey screen. \n",
    "- Another variable that was manipulated was **contrast** of the sine wave grating. There were 10 contrast levels: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 84, 100%. Contrast refers to the difference between the intensities (luminance) of the maximum (white) and minimum (black). Zero contrast would be a uniform grey stimulus (no different between max and minimum intensity), while 100% contrast would be the brightest white versus the blackest black that the monitor can produce.\n",
    "- within each condition (CTRL, ADAPT), each contrast level was presented 8 times. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell we define these as variables that we'll use later in the script, but here we'll also use them to visualize the experimental design:"

There are a few simple cells among the 23 included.\n",

Furthermore there is no dimension of either length 2 (conditions) or 10 (contrast levels). There *is* however a dimensions with 20 levels, so it looks like those two variables are combined in the data. Indeed, Dr. Crowder documented that the order of those 20 levels is all 10 contrast levels for the CTRL condition first, then all 10 contrast levels for the ADAPT condition. \n",

In our case, we are going to organize the DataFrame so that all of the data for one neuron come before any data from the next neuron. So `neuron` changes slowest. `time` will change fastest, because we want all the time points of one trial (`repetition`), in sequence, before any time points of the next trial. `repetition` changes next-fastest, followed by `contrast` level, followed by `condition`.\n",

The latter tells the method to read / write the elements with the first index (dimension of the input data) changing fastest, and the last index changing slowest (if you're curious, the `F` is for Fortran, a language which uses this ordering). In our case, the first index is `time`. We know this because the shape of the input data is (4000, 8, 20), so time is the first dimension of the data. and it makes sense to list all the time points for one trial before moving on to the next. We do need to be aware of this so that we can set up the labels for each data point correctly.
